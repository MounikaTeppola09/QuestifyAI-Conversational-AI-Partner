# QuestifyAI-Conversational-AI-Partner
QuestifyAI is a conversational AI tool designed to assist users in retrieving answers from uploaded documents. It utilizes a combination of a Stable LLM model and a VectorStoreIndex to generate responses based on user queries and the content of uploaded files.

## Features

- Document Upload: Users can upload various types of documents, including text files, PDFs, and images.
- Question-Answering: Users can ask questions, and QuestifyAI will provide answers based on the uploaded documents.
- Stable LLM Model: Powered by the StabilityAI StableLM-Zephyr-3B model for generating responses.
- VectorStoreIndex: Indexes uploaded documents for efficient retrieval of relevant information.

## Installation
 
Install the required dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

    1. Run the Streamlit app:

    streamlit run app.py

2. Upload documents using the sidebar interface.
3. Ask questions in the text input field and receive answers generated by QuestifyAI.

## Configuration

- The `BitsAndBytesConfig` class in the code handles quantization configurations for the model.
- You can modify parameters such as `temperature` and `context_window` to adjust the behavior of the Stable LLM model and the VectorStoreIndex, respectively.

## Acknowledgments

- The StableLM-Zephyr-3B model is provided by StabilityAI.
- This project is inspired by the need for conversational AI tools in various applications.
